Title: What is Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy?

----

Answer: Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy is a therapeutic process which helps patients understand and resolve their problems by increasing awareness of their inner world, both past and present and its influence over relationships. It gives the client space to explore and reflect on their life from infancy to the present day, to examine the relationships and events of the past which may contain the roots of present distress and to, over time, move towards a deep-seated change in personality and emotional development.
