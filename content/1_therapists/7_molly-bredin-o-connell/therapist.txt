Desc:

Molly offers individual therapy to adults in her clinic in Dublin 3. Using a psychoanalytic approach, she is particularly interested in exploring how a client’s problems may relate to unconscious processes, often with their roots in early life. Understanding this can facilitate change in relationships and quality of life.

Molly has worked in mental health for over seven years. She graduated with a Medical degree in 2013 and a Masters in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in 2021, both from Trinity College Dublin.
